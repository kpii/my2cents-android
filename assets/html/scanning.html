<p>my2cents uses the ZXing Barcode Scanner. In scanning mode it continuously scans a square region shown on your screen &mdash; just line up the phone so the barcode is completely inside the viewfinder rectangle:</p>

<p>When a barcode is read, my2cents plays a beep sound or vibrates. It then tries to identify the scanned product, connects to the my2cents server and display comments about the product.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble scanning, make sure to hold the phone steady. If the camera is unable to focus, try moving the phone further or closer from the barcode.</p>
