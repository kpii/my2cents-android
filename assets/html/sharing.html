<p>In addition to <a href="about2d.html">scanning 2D barcodes</a>, <b>Barcode Scanner</b> can also
  generate a QR Code and display it on your screen. Then you can show it to a friend, and let them
  scan the barcode with their phone:</p>

<p>To use this feature, press the Menu button from the main scanning screen, and tap Share. Then
  choose whether you want to share a contact, a bookmark, or the contents of the clipboard. A QR
  Code will be generated automatically. When you're done, press Back or Home.</p>
